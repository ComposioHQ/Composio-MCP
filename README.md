# Composio MCP CLI

A command-line interface (CLI) for configuring Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf with MCP servers.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g composio-mcp-cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx composio-mcp-cli
```

## Usage

The CLI provides three commands for configuring different AI clients with MCP servers:

### Claude

Configure Claude desktop with an MCP server:

```bash
composio claude <url>
```

This will save the configuration to Claude's configuration file.

### Cursor

Configure Cursor with an MCP server:

```bash
composio cursor <url>
```

This will save the configuration to Cursor's configuration file.

### Windsurf

Configure Windsurf with an MCP server:

```bash
composio windsurf <url>
```

This will save the configuration to Windsurf's configuration file.

## Examples

```bash
# Configure Claude with an MCP server
composio claude https://example.com/mcp

# Configure Cursor with an MCP server
composio cursor https://example.com/mcp

# Configure Windsurf with an MCP server
composio windsurf https://example.com/mcp
```

## Development

This project uses Vite for building the CLI.

```bash
# Install dependencies
